# INNOVATIVE BUSINESS MODELING TOOL FOR COMMERCIAL LAYER EGG PRODUCTION

LayInvest is a business modeling and decision-support system developed as part of an academic research project. It combines time-series forecasting (Prophet) with deterministic production and cost models to support financial planning in Sri Lanka’s commercial layer poultry industry. The tool generates weekly projections of revenue, costs, and profitability, helping farmers and investors make data-driven decisions.
