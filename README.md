# INNOVATIVE BUSINESS MODELING TOOL FOR COMMERCIAL LAYER EGG PRODUCTION

LayInvest is a financial forecasting and decision-support system built as part of a research project on Sri Lanka’s commercial layer poultry industry. The tool combines time-series forecasting (Prophet) with structured cost and production models to help farmers, investors, and researchers evaluate profitability under changing market conditions

The poultry sector in Sri Lanka faces challenges from volatile input costs (feed, DOCs, electricity, labour) and fluctuating egg and cull bird prices. LayInvest provides a simulation-based planning framework that generates weekly financial forecasts, break-even insights, and profitability projections to support better decision-making.
